# seng299
This repository is for our SENG 299 class project at UVic, Summer 2017. It contains the python chat room project.

To Do:
- change Server to only send to people in chatrooms - DONE
- change code so it works on more than just localhost
- handle switching rooms
- change Application to only use one queue (if possible)
- clean input (spaces, slashes, character limit) (possibly pad packets)
- GUI validation for invalid alias (error message needs to be shown)
- handle proper shutdown of clients (at least be able to remove them from the clientList on server side if they leave)
- server admin commands
- make GUI pretty
- database hookup (if time permits)
