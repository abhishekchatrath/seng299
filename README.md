# Seng 299 Chat System
This repository is for our SENG 299 class project at UVic, Summer 2017. It
contains our Chat System project written in Python2.

## Running the chat system:

### Run Server.py
The Server will run on port 9000. If you wish to have clients connect to the
Server remotely, make sure the firewall is off on the Server machine.

### Run Client.py
Upon running Client.py you will be prompted for an IP address. Please type
the IP address of the Server you wish to connect to. If you press Enter without
typing anything on this prompt, the Client will try to automatically connect to
localhost. Once the client has successfully connected to the server, the GUI 
will run. To run multiple clients connected to the same Server, just run
Client.py for each Client you wish to have.
