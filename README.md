# seng299
This repository is for our SENG 299 class project at UVic, Summer 2017. It contains the python chat room project.

To Do:
- remove unnecessary files from the repo
- change all print statements of packets to write to an external log file - DONE
- clean up code and write comments (make it readable)
- update the README so the marker will understand how to run the server and client
- rename Application.py and stuff to have names that make sense and suit our class diagram
